Apprenticeship Project
Who am I?
My name is Sam, im 22 and live in the Essex UK. I am currently doing an IT apprenticeship with a company in London as a software developer.</br>
I studied physics at Nottingham Trent University and after a painful year and a half decided to leave to find something other than education. I picked up the pieces and am now working full time for an amazing company and learning a lot.
I have so far conquered telesales and customer service and am now starting on my path of IT ascention starting with html (hence the website).
What is this website?
The idea of this website is to help me along with learning and to act as almost a "portfolio" to my achievements. Over the next 18 months I will be crossing a range of IT from C# to SQL databases and i want somewhere to throw it all together. So yes this website will look terrible until I learn what im doing, but Rome wasn't built in a day etc.
I am open to all feedback from anyone... From coding to design.
I also plan to mix this with my favourite hobby &ndash;&ndash; GAMING. The plan is to complete my steam library and review and rate the games I play and the fun I had. No small feat.
